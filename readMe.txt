In this project you can simulate the behavior, number and evolution of rabbits and foxes.
In the rabbits directory you can simulate the only rabbits, 
in the rabbits with children directory you can simulate rabbits who after pregnancy will give birth to a new rabbit after several rounds.
In the rabbits + foxes directory you can simulate rabbits and foxes in one environment. 
In .cpp files, you can change the value defined for the map size, which animals will move around 
and the likelihood of food appearing for rabbits at start of the round. 
Foxes eat only rabbits. 
In the map.txt file you can see the distribution of rabbits and foxes on the map.
In the animals.txt file you can see all animals that are in the simulation (to start simulation you have to put there some animals to start with).
Baby rabbits and baby foxes are the one that have not yet been born.
